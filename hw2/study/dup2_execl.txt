int X = open("./output_file.txt", O_WRONLY);

pid_t fk = fork();
if (!fk) { /* in child */
    dup2(X, 1); /* fd 1 is standard output,
                   so this makes standard out refer to the same file as X  */
    close(X);

    /* I'm using execl here rather than exec because
       it's easier to type the arguments. */
    execl("/bin/echo", "/bin/echo", "hello world");
    _exit(127); /* should not get here */
} else if (fk == -1) {
    /* An error happened and you should do something about it. */
    perror("fork"); /* print an error message */
}
close(X); /* The parent doesn't need this anymore */
This accomplishes running:

/bin/echo "hello world" > ./output_file.txt
